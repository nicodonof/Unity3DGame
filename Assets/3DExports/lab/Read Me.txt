To get textures to work properly in Blender (2.43):
1: Hit F6 to go to the textures panel
2: Press the folder and navigate the proper texture.
3: Blender will load the texure from that location instead of the previous location. All settings will be where they should be.

For help on what texture you need, look at the address bar (before you change it), and you should see "Rocky Wall.jpg", etc.
Use the corresponding texture.
You can also use the preview image on Turbo Squid for reference.
